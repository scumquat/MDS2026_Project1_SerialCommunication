## Requirements

This project requires numpy. It was developed using Python 3.12

Use 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install the following dependencies:

```python
numpy==2.2.2

```

## Implementation

This program can be run through main.py

There are two classes that main.py calls: ClassOne and ClassTwo.  Both classes allow outside function calls to add, clear, and get array values. ClassOne takes no input at initialization. ClassTwo takes an array at initialization.


## Error Handling

This project does not have any error handling. 


## References

This repo does not  have any references, but if using materials such as tutorials, websites, publications, etc. this is where they should be added in IEEE format.
